Parking Lot System
Design a parking lot system with the following requirements:

Create a ParkingLot class that manages parking spots for different vehicle types (e.g., car, bike, truck).

Each vehicle type takes up a different number of spots (e.g., car = 1 spot, truck = 4 spots).

Implement methods to parkVehicle, unparkVehicle, and checkAvailability.

Add a feature to calculate parking fees based on the duration of parking.

Write unit tests to verify parking, unparking, and fee calculation.
